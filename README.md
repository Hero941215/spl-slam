# spl-slam
**A visual SLAM using both point and line features. The system is built on the basis of [orb-slam2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2)**

** **

## 0. Features
The system uses line midpoint information to improve several modules, including front-end line feature matching, system initialization, and so on.

## 1. Prerequisites and Build

Prequisites and build are identical to [orb-slam2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2). The library related to line features has been integrated into Thirdparty and can be used directly.

## 2. Acknowledgments

Thanks for [orb-slam2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2).
